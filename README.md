# Storing tagged metrics in Clickhouse

[Automated demo](https://github.com/QratorLabs/inclickdb/blob/master/demo/README.md). Docker-compose application, that generates metrics, stores it to Clickhouse with the help of carbon-clickhouse and downloads database snapshot from Grafana.

[Template demo](https://github.com/QratorLabs/inclickdb/blob/master/template-demo/README.md). Same as the first one, but with ability to use influx templates.
